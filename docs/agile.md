## The Fundamentals

* [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

## Key Concepts

* Extreme Programming (XP)
* Kanban
* Lean
* Scrum

## Agile Adoption

* Antipatterns
* Case Studies
* Patterns

## Team and Roles

* Team
  * Agile Team
  * Team Building

  * Team Dysfunctions
* Product Owner
* Scrum Master
* Agile Coach

## Engineering

* Acceptance Testing
* Agile Architecture
* Agile Engineering Self Assessment
* Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
* Code Reviews
  * Let computers do the boring parts
    * Verify the code builds	
    * Verify automated tests pass
    * Verify code whitespace matches team style
    * Identify unused imports or unused variables
  * Settle style arguments with a style guide
    * Option 1: Adopt an existing style guide
    * Option 2: Create your own style guide incrementally
    * Option 3: The hybrid approach
  * Start reviewing immediately
  * Start high level and work your way down
  * Be generous with code examples
  * Never say “you”
    * Option 1: Replace ‘you’ with ‘we’
    * Option 2: Remove the subject from the sentence (“what about…” or “how about…”)
  * Frame feedback as requests, not commands
  * Tie notes to principles, not opinions
  * Aim to bring the code up a letter grade or two
  * Limit feedback on repeated patterns
  * Respect the scope of the review
  * Look for opportunities to split up large reviews
  * Offer sincere praise
  * Grant approval when remaining fixes are trivial
    * You have no more notes
    * Your remaining notes are for trivial issues
      * E.g., renaming a variable, fixing a typo
    * Your remaining notes are optional suggestions
      * Explicitly mark these as optional so that your teammate doesn’t assume your approval is contingent on them
  * Handle stalemates proactively
    * The tone of the discussion is growing tense or hostile
    * Your notes per review round are not trending downward
    * You’re getting pushback on an unusually high number of your notes
    * Talk it out
    * Consider a design review
    * Concede or Escalate
    * Recovering from a stalemate
      * Discuss the situation with your manager
      * Take a break from each other
      * Study conflict resolution
* Continuous Delivery
* Continuous Integration
* Domain Driven Design (DDD)
* InnerSource
* Pair Programming
* Refactoring
* Test Driven Development (TDD)
* Technical Debt

### Technical Debt
