Microservices -> A microservice architecture is the natural consequence of applying the single responsibility principle at the architectural level. This results in a number of benefits over a traditional monolithic architecture such as independent deployability, language, platform and technology independence for different components, distinct axes of scalability and increased architectural flexibility.

Rule of thumb is as small as possible but as big as necessary.

In some cases, an asynchronous publish-subscribe communication mechanism suits the use case better than a synchronous point-to-point mechanism. The Atom syndication format is becoming increasingly popular as a lightweight means of implementing pub-sub between microservices.
