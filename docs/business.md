## Products Ideas

Don’t just make projects, make products.

* Programmers
  1. SaaS
    * Automated business process: build a subscription model tool that does stuff for the user automatically (e.g. Stunning)
    * Integration: yep, an app that serves as a connector between two other services can be a SaaS (if that’s the kind of thing the audience will pay for)
    * Platform: software that makes it possible to do or put something on the internet, such as booking platform, courseware, content management, catalogs…
  2. Book
  3. Course
  4. Screencast, audio, presentation, webinar

  6. Kit
  7. Tool
  8. Library
  9. Plugin or Extension
    * JIRA, Wordpress, Salesforce, Shopify
* Designers
  1. Book
  2. Course
    * set of email lessons, or exercises, or videos, or a monthly subscription thing where you get new lessons every month, live workshop
  3. Screencast, audio, presentation, webinar
  4. Tool
    * Pick colors and fonts. Generate graphics and styles. Create flows, wireframes, layouts. Decide how to tackle a design problem. Decide how to define a design problem
    * Think decision-making, choice-defining, combining, rules, rubrics, guidelines, repeatable processes, checklists
    * Set of pre-made selections (like color palettes or font combos), a workbook, a slide deck, a spreadsheet, a calculator, and more
  5. Pack
    * Wireframes, buttons, widget or box designs, icons, fonts, illustrations or stock art
  6. Resource
    *  A typeface, icon, graphic, illustration or stock photo, a widget or box, a bit of HTML/CSS/JS, or even a little tool to customize or output something (like a spreadsheet that generates pretty graphs)
  7. Template
    * App interfaces (front end and back end), cart designs, static web sites, landing pages, presentations or slide decks, book layouts, covers or logos, buttons or graphical elements, processes such as onboarding or surveying, for corporate communications
  8. Theme
    * Wordpress, Shopify, Mailchimp
* Anyone
  * teach people taste (how to judge if something is good, or effective, or right, or right-for-now)
  * walk them through making a difficult decision (it’s teaching, but not the traditional skills way we think about it)
  * present options, with pro’s and con’s or even a decision tree
  * compile all the research, examples, or resources they’ll need
  * create a coherent narrative for something that is scattered among a million different sources
  * help them develop the confidence they need to act (sometimes people just need to know they’re not alone and they’re not doing something outlandish or crazy risky)

* Tools and technology
  * A monorepo architecture to promote transparency and code sharing
  * A DevOps pipeline that contains dynamic configuration, feature sites and is based around reusing a base build for all environments
  * High unit test coverage
  * Covered (minimum) the top 5 most important use cases of the system as end-to-end tests with Cypress

1. keep a running list of ideas
  * "what do I write about"

  * 3-5 bullet points about specific things
3. celebrate every post

## How to be great? Just be good, repeatably

> Perhaps “great’, is just “good”, but repeatable.

* Greatness is not instantaneous
* Greatness is earned

It’s Hard to be Consistent
