# Learning

## Feynman Technique

### 1. Identify the subject

Write down everything you know about the topic. Each time you run into new sources of information, add them to the note.

### 2. Teach it to a child

If you can teach a concept to a child, you’re way ahead of the game.

Start with a blank note and write the topic or subject you want to teach. Then, below that topic, write everything you know about it. But, the trick is to write it plainly and simply  so that a child can understand what you’re talking about.

* Speaking in plain terms
* Brevity

### 3. Identify your knowledge gaps

This is the point where the real learning happens. What are you missing? What don’t you know?

If you don’t know something, hit the books. Go back to the source material and compile information that will help you fill in the cracks.

### 4. Organize + simplify + Tell a story

Start to tell your story. Piece together your notes and begin to spin a tale using concise explanations. Bring the most vital pieces of your knowledge about the topic together.

Practice reading your story out loud. Pretend to tell the story to a classroom of students. That way, you’ll hear where language stops being simple. Stumbles could indicate incomplete thoughts.

Use analogies and simple sentences to strengthen your understanding of the story.

## Drawing on passions

Feynman was a believer in a multi-disciplinary approach to learning and found connections to his work in creative outlets like drawing and music. He never stopped asking questions  who, what, and why?
